# O
I have learnt how to use flyway with db when using springboot. I have also learnt how to build web app with React.

# R
I think flyway is a good tool to track database migration. And the React homework is challenging to me.

# I
I have rarely made web app from scratch. This is a great lesson for letting me to understand the fundamentals of React. At work, I have also never do any versioned database migration. I believe that flyway could enable me to do database migration in a better manner.

# D
I would adopt flyway at my future work. Through this lesson, my weakness in frontend development is also revealed. I will do more self-study on frontend.
